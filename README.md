# inside-art-piece

Colored pencil art piece of the inside of a building. I restarted halfway through the piece (the original piece is draft1, and the new (final) piece is draft2). Each picture is taken approximately 1 hour apart. You can read my reflection in reflection.jpg, and see the final piece in inside.png.
